This is a of a hole year of work at Complubot (2018).
You can see an iterative process of learning along the three projects done.

## Bluetooth
In this first aproach to the problem we worked with the [HC-05 Bluetooth module](https://aprendiendoarduino.wordpress.com/tag/hc-05/ "HC-05 Bluetooth module") and the AT commands. We made a robot based on the [Compluino03 board](http://complubot.com/inicio/proyectos/compluino-03/ "Compluino03 board"). One we had that we started making some custom hardware to the board like allowing it to receive arduino compiled code through the bluetooth module to the serial port in a wireless way.

## Camareros y ladrones
At this point we wanted to prove that the [Compluino03 board](http://complubot.com/inicio/proyectos/compluino-03/ "Compluino03 board") was a powerful tool that not only provided all hardware you need to cover the basics in robotics but also could be customized and enhance to do whatever basic robot you could though of. To accomplish that we created some structures to do a total of three different battle robots. We also created a game (camareros y ladrones), the goal of the game was to take carry a piece of wood on the top of the robot without securing it and try to take done the enemy's piece without yours falling.
We won booth fights!!!
